/**
 * Event Template Partial
 *
 * This file contains the ACF and php code for use in the template builder (page.php).
 * Must be inside flex content, all of this code uses subfields. It won't work standalone.
 *
 * This template has a simplified WYSIWYG editor for any header content
 * Additionally, it accepts an event type from the content editor, and the code + WP does the heavy lifting.
 * It will always pull in the 3 upcoming events in the type chosen, or say there aren't any.
 *
 * Usage: get_template_part( 'components/blocks/event-type' );
 *
 * @package WordPress
