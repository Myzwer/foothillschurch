/**
 * Announcement Template Partial
 *
 * This file contains the ACF and php code for use in the template builder (page.php).
 * Must be inside flex content, all of this code uses subfields. It won't work standalone.
 *
 * It generates a simple WYSIWYG editor for high profile information.
 * It also adds a saltydog background, overriding the counter used in the rest of the blocks.
 *
 * Usage: get_template_part( 'components/blocks/announcement' );
