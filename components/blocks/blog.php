/**
 * Blog Block Template Partial
 *
 * This file contains the ACF and php code for use in the template builder (page.php).
 * Must be inside flex content, all of this code uses subfields. It won't work standalone.
 *
 * It generates a header image and a full WYSIWYG editor in a "blog" style (1/3 screen on desktop).
 * Also generates some social icons if you want. Gotta be at the bottom though.
 *
 * Usage: get_template_part( 'components/blocks/blog' );
 *
 * @package WordPress
 * @subpackage Bootcamp_2
 * @author Josh Forrester <josh@onefortyfivedesign.com>
